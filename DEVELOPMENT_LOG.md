# Development Log - Fruit Service RMI Application
**Course**: MIT8102 Advanced Distributed Systems  
**Institution**: Strathmore University  
**Group Members**: [Onyango Bruce - 121063]

## Project Setup and Understanding Requirements
**Activities**:
- Analyzed assignment requirements for distributed fruit service system
- Identified need for RMI (Remote Method Invocation) implementation
- Decided on 3-tier architecture: Android Client → Servlet → RMI Server
- Set up development environment with Java JDK and Android Studio
---

## RMI Interface and Task Design
  
**Activities**:
- Created `Compute.java` interface for RMI remote methods
- Designed `Task.java` interface for serializable task objects
- Implemented task pattern for different operations (Add, Update, Delete, Calculate)

**Key Decisions**:
- Used Task pattern to allow different operations through single RMI interface
- Made all task classes implement Serializable for network transmission
- Decided on String return types for simplicity

---

## Data Model and Business Logic

**Activities**:
- Created `FruitPrice.java` model class with proper serialization
- Implemented `PurchaseItem.java` for receipt calculations
- Designed business logic for fruit operations

---

## RMI Server Implementation

**Activities**:
- Implemented `FruitComputeEngine.java` extending UnicastRemoteObject
- Set up RMI registry creation and binding
- Implemented server startup with proper error handling


---

## RMI Client Registry

**Activities**:
- Created `FruitComputeTaskRegistry.java` for client-side RMI calls
- Implemented registry lookup and remote method invocation
- Added error handling for network failures

---

## Servlet Layer Implementation
**Activities**:
- Implemented servlet classes for each operation
- Set up HTTP parameter parsing and JSON response formatting
- Integrated servlets with RMI client registry

---

## Android Client Development  
**Activities**:
- Created Android project with multiple activities
- Implemented HTTP client using OkHttp library
- Designed UI layouts for each operation
- Added proper threading for network calls

---

## Integration and Testing
 
**Activities**:
- Integrated all components (Android → Servlet → RMI)
- End-to-end testing of complete system
- Fixed integration issues
---


## Documentation and Code Cleanup
**Activities**:
- Added comprehensive code comments
- Created README files
- Organized project structure
- Prepared submission materials
- Prepared System Screenshots
---

## Final Summary  
**Key Technologies Used**:
- Java RMI for distributed computing
- Java Servlets for web tier
- Android for mobile client
- HTTP/JSON for communication

**Major Learning Outcomes**:
1. Understanding of distributed system architecture
2. RMI implementation and network communication
3. Multi-tier application design
4. Integration of different technologies

**System Capabilities Achieved**:
- ✅ Distributed fruit price management
